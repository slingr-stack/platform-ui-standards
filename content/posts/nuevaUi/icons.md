### Icon Standards

In the new UI, we will be using updated icon libraries to ensure a modern, consistent look:

- **Approved libraries**: Use icons from the **PrimeNG** and **Font Awesome** libraries.
- **Deprecated library**: Avoid using icons from the old Bootstrap library, as it is no longer supported in the new UI.

*Note:* Ensure icons are uniform in size and style to maintain a cohesive appearance across all components.
