## **Themes and Colors**

Themes are composed of the following list of colors:
- Primary
- Secondary
- Tertiary
- Info

These are generally provided by clients, who will give us the necessary guidance to identify each color.
It is recommended that for **Warning, Danger, and Success** colors, we use yellows, reds, and greens that contrast well with the theme. We can obtain these from the client or by consulting with UX.
