## **Labels**

For labels, we have decided to modify the responsive behavior (wrapping) for HTML Tags. If any adjustments are made to the default labels, they should be aligned with these changes.

We have added an improvement by setting **word-break** to **auto-phrase**. This change was made because we were previously cutting off words to save space without considering usability. For longer strings, it's logical to display the entire word on a single line (such as an ID), so this change aligns with our policy.
